div Hey, I'm Jordan Santell, a JavaScript engineer all up in node.js apps and tools, audio programming and making sweet frameworks. Creator of <a href="http://github.com/jsantell/dancer.js" title="dancer.js">dancer.js</a>, I'm currently slamming down code at <a href="http://weblinc.com" title="WebLinc">WebLinc</a>. Scope out my <a href="/projects" title="Projects">open source projects</a>, where each line of js is like a love note, carefully crafted and sealed with a kiss.
